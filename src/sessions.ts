 * as a number that is quietly too small. That is the existing, designed
 * degradation for incomplete coverage, not a new failure mode, and "unknown"
 * beats "wrong" for a figure the user reads as money.

 * **Known limitation, accepted rather than fixed.** A rewind that lands INSIDE
 * the folded prefix is lossy: `truncateResolvedAfter` filters entries by
 * `afterUserMessage`, and the carry sits at the last dropped turn, so rewinding
 * to an earlier turn discards the carry and with it the usage of turns that
