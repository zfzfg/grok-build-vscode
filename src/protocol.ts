// Single source of truth for the host <-> webview message contract.
//
// Two directions, two discriminated unions:
//   - HostMsg     — posted by the extension host (sidebar.ts) to the webview.
//   - WebviewMsg  — posted by the webview (chat.js) back to the host.
//
// Why this file exists: the host->webview direction used to be `post(msg: any)`,
// so a typo'd field or a renamed shape only surfaced as a silently mis-rendered
// (or dropped) message in the webview — the "post one shape, handle another"
// class of bug this project has hit around restore, history pagination, and
// media. Typing `post`/`emit` against HostMsg turns those into compile errors.
//
// The exhaustive `Record<Union["type"], true>` maps below force the runtime
// *_MESSAGE_TYPES arrays to list exactly the union's discriminants (a missing or
// extra key is a tsc error). A companion test (test/protocol.test.ts) asserts the
// webview's own copy of those arrays (media/webview-helpers.js) matches these, and
// that chat.js actually handles every HostMsg type — closing the loop across the
// TS/JS boundary that tsc can't see.
//
// All payload-shape imports are `import type` so this module carries no runtime
// dependency on vscode/acp/etc. — it compiles to just the two arrays, and the
// test can import it without a VS Code environment.
